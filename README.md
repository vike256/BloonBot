# BloonBot
Original: https://github.com/RavingSmurfGB/Py_AutoBloons  
This is my version of the bot made by RavingSmurfGB.  
The original didn't seem to work so I made my own.  

## How It Works
This program will select the map Dark Castle and beat it on easy difficulty while collecting any levels and event items.  
It will use the Hero OBYN (Which will be selected auto if not), a submarine and a ninja monkey to beat the game. 

#### EliteCreature Note:
Installation Instructions are in RavingSmurfGB's Py_AutoBloons repository linked above.
Check 'requirements.txt' for python modules you need to install.

Monkey Knowledges:
----------------
More Cash          - Increase Starting Cash by 200. [Without this the Obyn spawn can't be completed and thus you lose the round]
Big Bloon Sabotage - All MOAB-Class Bloons spawn in a partially damaged state. [Without this your rounds will take longer and might go beyond the timer]
Bigger Banks       - Monkey Banks can hold 2500 extra money. [Without this, your banks will sit at 7000 for 2 to 3 rounds without being picked up]
Other MKs of import will already be had if you have the MKs above.
